## Overview
Project Overview: Personal Portfolio Website
What is the project?
This project is a personal portfolio website developed as the final requirement to pass the course. It serves as a digital space to introduce myself, showcase my academic work, creative outputs, and provide a means for others to get in touch with me.

What’s the purpose?
The primary purpose of this project is to:

Fulfill course requirements.

Present a clean and organized online portfolio.

Share personal and academic information in a professional format.

Display my growth and development through school projects and creative outputs.

Provide an accessible contact form for communication.

What are the key components?
The website is composed of the following main sections:

Homepage: A brief landing page that introduces who I am.

About Me: Contains more detailed information about where I study, my hobbies, and some personal background.

Projects: Showcases some of my school work, including WD Seatwork 1 and Seatwork 2.

Gallery: A collection of photos I’ve taken, showing off my photography and creative eye.

Contacts: A contact form that allows visitors to send a message, along with links to my social media profiles.

What technology is used and how is it used?
The website is built using:

HTML5: For structuring the content of the pages.

CSS3: For styling and layout, including responsive design, custom buttons, and visual effects like glowing titles and animated icons.

Ionicons: For including social media icons in the "My Socials" section.

Google Fonts (Poppins): For modern, readable typography.

All pages are connected via internal links and styled with an external CSS file for consistency. Interactive elements such as social buttons are made visually engaging and linked to open in new tabs, enhancing user experience.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
